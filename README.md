Some old C/C++ projects runnable in DOS (or DosBox)

This repository contains some old C/C++ game projects of mine that were coded somewhere in the early 2000's using Borland C++ Compiler. 
Included here are source codes for the games and compiled executables in RAR-files. These run in DosBox which can be downloaded from [https://www.dosbox.com]
